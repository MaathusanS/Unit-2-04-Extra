 <h4 style="font-size:130%;color:pink;font-family:cambria;">Here is a poem:</h4>
 <hr>
<pre>
<p style="color:white;">No man is an island,
Entire of itself,
Every man is a piece of the continent,
A part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less.
As well as if a promontory were.
As well as if a manor of thy friend’s
Or of thine own were:
Any man’s death diminishes me,
Because I am involved in mankind,
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
It tolls for thee.</p>
